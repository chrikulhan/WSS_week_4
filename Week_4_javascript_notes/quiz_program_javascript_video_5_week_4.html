<!--Write your HTML content here-->
  <p>What is the capital of Wisconsin?</p>
  <button class="wrong-answer">Bayfield</button>
    <!--differentiate the right answer from the wrong answer
    Give the correct answer the id="correct-answer"-->
    <!--**Following CSS style recommendations (names separated by dashes)-->
  <button id="correct-answer">Madison</button>
  <button class="wrong-answer">Milwaukee</button>
  <!--^^^used <button class="wrong-answer"> to select multiple wrong answers at a time.-->

  <p id="result"></p>

<script>
// <!--  create temporary variable to try out the document.querySelector-->
//   let button = document.querySelector('button')
//   console.log(button)
//   This ^^^ will return the first thing that matches, not useful to select
//    all the wrong answers at the same time, but must be at the top to see it.

  //Select the correct answer button by ID
  let correctAnswerButton = document.querySelector('#correct-answer')
    // console.log(correctAnswerButton) //used to check if this works correctly by looking
  //in the console on the web dev tools

  //Save the default color of the buttons in this page:vvv
  //This is saving whatever the original color was to set it back to.
  let defaultButtonColor = correctAnswerButton.style.background

  //Select the result paragraph by ID. This will be used to
  //display a 'Correct answer!' message when the user clicks the correct
  //button
  let result = document.querySelector('#result')

  //add query selector All to find all the wrong answers in our page:
  //this is selecting the CSS class ('.wrong-answer')
  let wrongAnswerButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.wrong-answer')
  // console.log(wrongAnswerButtons) //used to check if this works correctly by looking
//in the console on the web dev tools

//  add an event listener to both wrong answer buttons, need some kind of a loop.
// more common way to write loops:
  wrongAnswerButtons.forEach(function(wrongAnswerButton) { //loop = repeats for each
    //element in the wrongAnswerButtons nodeList

    //forEach has one argument which is another function definition.
    //check: //console.log(wrongAnswerButton) //shows in the dev tools log where all this
    //element is.

    wrongAnswerButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
      result.innerHTML = 'Wrong answer, try again?'

      //This was added to change the correct answer to change back when the wrong
      //answer is subsequently pressed: vvv
      correctAnswerButton.style.background = defaultButtonColor

      //So now when you look at the page, the correct answer says, "Correct answer",
      //and the wrong answer says," Wrong answer, try again?
    })
  })

//***Imperative-style for loop could be used in place of "wrongAnswerButtons.forEach(above)***
// -x is the loop counter, counts how many times a loop needs to repeat
// -x++ is what you do after every each loop counter to increase x by one.
// -when do you stop the loop? when x is greater than the wrong answer buttons.
// -or repeat when x is less than the wrongAnswerButtons:
//   for (let x=0; x, wrongAnswerButtons.length; x++){
//     let wrongAnswerButton = wrongAnswerButtons(x) //indexing the nodelist.
//
//     wrongAnswerButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
//       result.innerHTML = 'Wrong answer, try again?'
//       correctAnswerButton.style.background = defaultButtonColor
//   })

  //Add event listener to the correct answer button
  correctAnswerButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
    result.innerHTML = 'Correct answer!' //Display message in the result paragraph.
  //change the style of the Madison button when it's clicked:
    correctAnswerButton.style.background ='yellow'
        //wrong answer, nothing happened, the style of the Madison button changes when
        //it is clicked to yellow.

  //***Add the same event listener to all the wrong answers at the same time.***
  //Finding elements with querySelector and querySelectorAll
    // Select element(s) using CSS selectors
  //document.querySelector returns:
    // -the first match even if many elements match.
    // -Returns null if nothing matches
  //document.querySelectorAll:
    // -returns a NodeList* of all matching elements;
    // -returns an empty NodeList if nothing matches

  //   *NodeList is like a list of elements, can loop over it, access element by index

  //  How do we select multiple items at the same time?
  //  Add a class to the <button> in HTML
  //  example:: added to above HTML <button class =" wrong answer">Bayfield</button>
