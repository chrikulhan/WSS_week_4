  //notes:
  // **Form Processing and Validation**

  // -JavaScript is commonly used for form processing and validation
  //  one of the earliest uses for JavaScript

  //  -Checking for missing data, or invalid data, and warning the user
  //   before a form is submitted to a server for processing
  //   can save a lot of frustration
  //examples: let credit card user know their card isn't the correct length

//   **Forms**

  //   Two types – some work with data on the client side;
  //    usually with client-side JavaScript
  //   Another example: http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_celsius

  //   -Some submit data to a web server to be processed by server-side code
  //   (more on this later in the class); examples username and password;
  //   order/payment info for ecommerce sites
      //   -But, you can precede server processing with client-side JavaScript validation
      //   -Better user experience, saves a server round-trip with invalid data if errors
      //    can be corrected at the client
          //   -For example, client-side JS can check if a credit card number is the right length,
          //      the expiry date is a valid date and is in the future…
          //   -The server will still need to check if the card can be used for the transaction

  // ***If Statements ***

    // Similar operators as Java, C#, Python
  //  == is exactly (equals)
  //  <   less than
  //  <=  less than or equal
  //  >   greater than
  //  >=  greater than or equals
  //  !=  NOT equal
    // And two extras === and !==
  //**More stringent^^ test of equality.

      // -The ( ) around the condition are required
      // -Use { } to contain the conditional statement(s)

  let orderQuantity = -1

  if(orderQuantity < 0) {
    console.log('Error - cannot order a negative number!')
    //This would still work as expected if orderQuantity
    // was the string "-1" (if it had quotes around it.)
    // JavaScript does **type coercion** -
        // it will try to convert one of the operands to make the
        // comparison make sense

  }

  // ***If Statements**

  // Use three equal signs to force JS to check the type of the variable
  // being compared
  // Also !== operator

  //**Type coercion**
    //Where the double equals and triple equals have different utility.

  let grade = 100

  //check if the type the same AND the data the same? use ===
  if(grade ===100){
    console.log('You aced the quiz!')
  }

  //when doing form validation, typically use ==
  if(grade =='100'){
    console.log('The number 100 is the same as the string "100" with' +
            'double equals ==')
  }

  if (grade === '100'){
    console.log('This will not be printed')
  } else {
    console.log('The number 100 is NOT the same as the string "100"' +
            'with triple equals ===')
  }
