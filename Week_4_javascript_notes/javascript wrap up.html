<!--***Recap: Manipulating DOM***-->

<!--Identify which elements should respond to what type of events-->
<!--In JavaScript,-->
    <!--Find that element: by id or class attributes, or get all elements by tag-->
    <!--Add the correct event listener to that element(s) to call a function when
    that event happens-->
<!--Write the function that should respond to that event-->
    <!--In your function, you can write code to locate other elements in the page;
    modify those elements, add new elements, add styles, add classes-->
